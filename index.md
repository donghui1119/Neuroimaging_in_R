# Neuroimage Processing Tutorials for  R-users

Recently, more and more neuroimaging processing packages were complied to R package from original codes, which makes neuroimage proccessing more convinent to start their neuroimaging research for who familiar R language. I am going to introduce some R packages and tutorials for R-users in the tutorial.
